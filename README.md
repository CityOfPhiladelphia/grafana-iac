# Moved

As of 02/12/2026, Grafana no longer lives in a dedicated Kubernetes cluster. It is now part of the [citygeo-variety-cluster](https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/citygeo-variety-cluster-gitops), AWS infrastructure controlled by [citygeo-variety-iac](https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/citygeo-variety-iac)
